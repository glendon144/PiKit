Hypertext is standardized through the use of various protocols and technologies, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). These standards define how information is structured, accessed, and displayed on the web. Additionally, organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) work to develop and maintain standards for hypertext technologies to ensure interoperability and consistency across different platforms and devices.
