The decision of whether or not a woman should be pursued is a personal one and ultimately depends on individual preferences and beliefs. Some women may appreciate being pursued and enjoy traditional gender roles in relationships, while others may prefer a more equal and mutual approach to dating and relationships. It is important to communicate openly and honestly with the woman in question to understand her preferences and boundaries. Ultimately, mutual respect, communication, and understanding are key in any relationship.
