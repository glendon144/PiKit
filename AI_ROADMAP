To create a system that works like Doug Englebart's NLS (oN-Line System) in "the mother of all demos" using Python, you would need to combine several different technologies and libraries to replicate the functionality of the original system. Here are some steps to get you started:

1. Use a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt to create a graphical user interface for your system. This will allow you to display windows, menus, and other interactive elements on the screen.

2. Implement a text editor component that supports rich text formatting, similar to the one used in NLS. You can use a library like Tkinter's Text widget or a more advanced library like Pyside's QTextEdit.

3. Add support for collaborative editing by implementing a real-time communication system. You can use a library like sockets or websockets to allow multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously.

4. Implement a command input system that allows users to enter commands using a keyboard shortcut or a special input field. You can use a library like Tkinter's Entry widget to create an input field for users to type in commands.

5. Integrate other features of NLS, such as the ability to create hyperlinks, embed images, and organize information in a hierarchical structure. You can use libraries like Markdown or HTML parsers to handle these features.

By combining these technologies and libraries, you can create a system that emulates the functionality of Doug Englebart's NLS in "the mother of all demos" using Python. Keep in mind that this is a complex project and may require significant time and effort to complete.
